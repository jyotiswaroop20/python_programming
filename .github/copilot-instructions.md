# AI Coding Guidelines for Python Learning Repository

## Project Overview
This repository contains standalone Python practice files for learning programming fundamentals. Each `.py` file demonstrates a specific concept with explanatory comments and runnable examples.

## File Naming Conventions
- Concept files: `topic_in_python.py` (e.g., `function_in_python.py`, `list_in_python.py`)
- Practice exercises: `practice_question_topic.py` or `practice_question.py` (numbered for multiple)
- Avoid spaces; use underscores for multi-word names

## Code Style and Structure
- Include concept explanations in comments/docstrings at file start
- Demonstrate with simple, runnable examples using `print()` for output
- Follow patterns from existing files like `function_in_python.py` (function definitions with examples) or `oops_in_python-1.py` (class definitions with methods and f-string formatting)
- Use descriptive variable names and basic Python syntax
- Use f-strings for string interpolation in print statements (e.g., `print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")`)
- No external dependencies; pure Python 3.x code
- For OOP files, include docstrings for classes and methods as shown in `oops_in_python-1.py`

## Execution
Run any script directly: `python filename.py`
Examples work standalone with console input/output.
No build process or virtual environments required.

## Practice Implementation
For exercise files, implement solutions similar to `practice_question.py`:
- Use `input()` for user data where applicable
- Basic conditional logic and direct code execution
- Direct `print()` statements for results
- Keep solutions simple and educational; functions may be used but are not required

## Key Reference Files
- `hello_world.py`: Basic print statements
- `function_in_python.py`: Function definitions, calls, and various function types with examples
- `oops_in_python-1.py`: Class/object examples with inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- `practice_question.py`: Simple problem-solving pattern with user input and conditionals
- `list_in_python.py`: Data structure operations with iterative examples

Focus on educational clarity over optimization. Each file should teach one concept effectively through immediate, executable examples.
